libgdav
=======

libgdav is a GObject-based library for performing WebDAV operations using
libsoup.  It can be thought of as an extension of libsoup, just as WebDAV
is an extension of HTTP.

libgdav methods can execute synchronously or asynchronously and follow the
conventions established by GIO.  The methods hide assembling XML requests
and parsing XML responses behind a public API of GObject types.

libgdav was inspired by and is loosely based on Philip Withnall's design
for libgdata.

The package includes an interactive command-line tool 'gdav' -- which is
a blatant rip off of 'cadaver' (http://www.webdav.org/cadaver/) -- whose
purpose is primarily to exercise libgdav for debugging and testing.

libgdav is licensed under the LGPL; see COPYING for more details.
